    <p> Hello everyone. My name is Sukhnoor Sahota. I'm a transfer student so it's my first year at UCSC. Right now I'm living off campus but hopefully will move during the spring to Santa Cruz.Hello everyone. My name is Sukhnoor Sahota. I'm a transfer student so it's my first year at UCSC. I'm a social science major but I'm interested in learning more about coding. Fun fact about me is that my name means peace and light in Punjabi. Some of my hobbies are painting, biking, trying new foods, thrifting with my friends. I'm really exicted about this class and what I can learn from it.  </p>
