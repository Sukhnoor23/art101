<h2 id="title-Challenges">Challenges:</h2>
		<p> The challenges for this lab was figuring out the write way to write in the console. You have to make sure all the spacing and variables are correct.
		The script has to be correct or else javascript will not produce what you would like such as calculating something or the variables not showing up when it should.
		Another challenging part is making sure everything shows up on the website and it's all working properly.</p>

<h3 id="title-Problems">Problems:</h3>
		<p> So far the problems I have been having was correctly outputting the script show it shows up correctly on the webpage. Also another problem was linking the image
			but I figured both those out with trial and error.

<h4 id="title-Result">Results:</h4>
		<p> The result is the webpage that shows lab 5. </p>
